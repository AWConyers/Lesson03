          <h3>Akimbo + Art and Culture magazine</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/Akimbo10x12.jpg" alt="Issue Cover">
          <p>Akimbo is an art and culture magazine created by a young group of artists. 
            The purpose of the magazine is to help celebrate the alternative styles of both underground and contemporary art. 
            Each magazine features striking imagery from various artists, relevant articles, events, and new ideas to ponder. 
            The challenge of the publication is balancing these different styles to create a cohesive visual identity.</p>
            
            <p>The work featured in this mock-up is my mothers’ and my own. Our interests led us down similar career paths. 
            One of her dreams was to have her work displayed on a magazine cover, so I made that wish come true. 
            These spreads are a sample of the multipage layout that a magazine like Akimbo would require. 
            I used colors present in her work to create visually exciting design elements.</p>

          <img src="placeholder images/collage1.jpg" alt="Video Backdrop">
          <p>Visual branding created for Cliff Morris. These collage illustrations would be used as backdrops to his music aligning with his style.
            Animations were created across the collages various elements to create a fun, interesting enviornment that reacted to the audio of the music.  </p>

          <h3>Foundry</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/Foundry snip.JPG" alt="Direct Mailer">
          <p>
            Foundry is a high-end, handcrafted men’s grooming/wash brand forged in Denver, Colorado. 
            The company focuses on providing natural, healthy products to men worldwide, with a heightened stance against chemicals and other harmful ingredients. 
            The overall idea is to reverse the concept that all products are mass-produced in a factory somewhere and that even today, each product can be made by hand, with care. 
            It’s a concept that has lost itself in the time of automation.</p>

          <p>
            I was responsible for carrying Foundry’s message by pairing it with handcrafted design and branding to complement their statement. 
            The design process was to require the same resource that goes into each of their products, time. 
            I conducted many font and color studies to give the company an old-western theme.</p>
