          <img src="placeholder images/Akimbo10x12.jpg" alt="Issue Cover">
          <p>Akimbo is an art and culture magazine created by a young group of artists. The purpose of the magazine is to help celebrate the alternative styles of both underground and contemporary art. Each magazine features striking imagery from various artists, relevant articles, events, and new ideas to ponder. The challenge of the publication is balancing these different styles to create a cohesive visual identity.</p>

          <img src="placeholder images/Foundry snip.JPG" alt="Direct Mailer">
          <p>I was responsible for carrying Foundry’s message by pairing it with handcrafted design and branding to complement their statement. The design process was to require the same resource that goes into each of their products, time. I conducted many font and color studies to give the company an old-western theme.</p>
